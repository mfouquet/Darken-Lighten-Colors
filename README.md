##Installation
1. Download the plugin and double-click to install.

##Usage
No more and no less than one layer can be selected. You can have any type of
shape or text selected.

By default, 10% is bound to the hotkeys `ctrl alt -` (darken) and `ctrl alt +` (lighten). 
You can move those hotkeys around in the manifest.json file.
